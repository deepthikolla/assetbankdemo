Repository to demonstrate the behave tests for Asset Bank

Installation

Install Python 2.7.10 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/. As part of your installation, please also ensure that you install pip, which is a tool that allows easy management of any Python packages that you wish to use. Installers for versions prior to Python 2.7.9 will not have pip bundled, so if you do choose to use an earlier version, please ensure you manually install pip.

You can now use the following commands to install the Selenium, Behave and Nose packages:

pip install selenium
pip install behave
pip install nose

Execution
You can now run behave from pypi_automated_tests/
